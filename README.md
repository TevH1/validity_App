This is a model that is made to check if a comment was written by a human or artificial intelligence. 
Summary: This project is a classifier model that classifies whether a comment was written by a human or artificial intelligence. To complete this task I implemented and utilazed ensemble learning methods, creating 4-5 models that ultimately work together to produces a final classifying response and its confidence. Initial data preprocessing and transformation was done on a subset of 100k human written comments, from huggingface. Models used are:    Libraries used are:
